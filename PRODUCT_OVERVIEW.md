# Parlay Streak - Product Overview

## The Pitch

**"ESPN Streak for the Cash meets Parlay Building"**

Parlay Streak is a social sports prediction game where players build winning streaks by making smart picks on live sporting events. The twist? Players can combine bets from **any games** into custom parlays throughout the day, managing multiple simultaneous parlays that resolve in real-time. With a strategic insurance system that evolves as your streak grows, the game creates natural phases of risk and reward that keep even the best players on edge.

**Core Hook:** Build your strategy across an entire day of sports - stack single bets for safe growth, or combine 5 picks across multiple games for massive gains (+16). With multiple active parlays and strategic insurance, every resolution moment changes your streak and keeps you coming back.

---

## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **Browse daily games** - Scroll through curated sporting events on the main page
2. **Select bets** - Choose from featured bets or click into games to see 5-10 additional options
3. **Build parlays** - Combine 1-5 bets from any games into a single parlay
4. **Lock multiple parlays** - You can have multiple active parlays at once throughout the day
5. **Parlays resolve in order** - As games finish, your parlays resolve chronologically
6. **All picks must hit** - If everything hits, your streak grows. If anything misses (uninsured), streak resets to 0.
7. **Compete on leaderboards** - Longest current streak wins

**The Strategy:** You control risk by choosing how many bets per parlay and whether to insure. Build multiple safe parlays or go big on one massive 5-bet parlay. Timing and bet selection across different games creates deep strategic gameplay.

## Core Game Rules

### Building Your Streak

**How Bet Selection Works:**

**Main Page:**
- Scroll through all available games for the day
- Each game displays a featured "main bet" (ML, spread, over/under, etc.)
- Quick-select featured bets or click into games for more options

**Game Detail Page:**
- Click any game to see 5-10 additional curated bets:
  - Player performance props (points, rebounds, assists)
  - Game outcome props (winning margin, total score ranges)
  - Team/player-specific props

**Building Parlays:**
- Select 1-5 bets from ANY games (not limited to single game)
- Add bets throughout the day until you lock in your parlay
- Can build multiple different parlays simultaneously
- Each parlay locks when its first game starts

**Parlay Values:**
- 1 bet: **+1**
- 2 bets: **+2**
- 3 bets: **+4**
- 4 bets: **+8**
- 5 bets: **+16**

**Example Parlay:**
- Lakers ML (1pm game)
- Steph Curry over 28.5 pts (4pm game)
- Bucks -5 (7pm game)
- Total: 3 bets = **+4** to streak if all hit

**The Catch:** ALL bets in a parlay must hit to advance your streak. If any miss (and uninsured), your streak resets to 0.

**Key Point:** All bets are curated by the platform. You're choosing from pre-selected options, not creating custom bets.

### Parlay Resolution

**Multiple Active Parlays:**
- You can have multiple parlays active at the same time
- Each resolves independently as its games finish
- Parlays resolve in **chronological order** (by when the last game in each parlay finishes)

**Resolution Order Matters:**
- Your streak changes with each parlay resolution
- If Parlay A loses (uninsured) → Streak resets to 0
- Parlay B then resolves from 0
- This continues sequentially

**Example Timeline:**
- Start: Streak at 20
- 3pm: Parlay A finishes (+2) → HITS → Streak: 22
- 5pm: Parlay B finishes (+4) → HITS → Streak: 26
- 8pm: Parlay C finishes (+1) → MISSES → Streak: 0
- 9pm: Parlay D finishes (+8) → HITS → Streak: 8 (built from 0)

### Winning & Losing

**When ALL your picks hit:**
- Add the value to your streak
- Continue playing

**When ANY pick misses:**
- Streak resets to 0
- Start building again immediately

**No Negative Streaks:** Your streak bottoms out at 0, you can never go negative.

---

## Insurance System

### What Is Insurance?

Insurance protects your streak. If you buy insurance and your picks miss, you only lose the insurance cost instead of your entire streak.

### Insurance Rules

**Availability:**
- Only available on **4-pick parlays (+8)** and **5-pick parlays (+16)**
- Available at any streak level
- Not available on 1-pick (+1), 2-pick (+2), or 3-pick (+4) parlays

**How It Works:**
1. Select your parlay (must be 4-pick or 5-pick)
2. Option to buy insurance appears
3. Insurance cost is deducted immediately when you place the bet
4. **If parlay HITS:** Gain full value minus insurance cost
5. **If parlay MISSES:** Only lose insurance cost (streak survives)

**Example:**
- Current streak: 20
- Select 4-pick parlay (+8)
- Insurance costs: 5
- **Parlay hits:** 20 - 5 + 8 = **23** (+3 net)
- **Parlay misses:** 20 - 5 = **15** (survived!)

### Insurance Cost Scaling

Insurance becomes more expensive as your streak grows:

| Streak Level | Cost Multiplier | +8 Parlay Cost | +8 Net Result | +16 Parlay Cost | +16 Net Result |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 0-9          | 1.0x            | 5              | Win: +3 / Lose: -5 ✓ | 9 | Win: +7 / Lose: -9 ✓ |
| 10-24        | 1.25x           | 6              | Win: +2 / Lose: -6 ✓ | 11 | Win: +5 / Lose: -11 ✓ |
| 25-34        | 1.5x            | 8              | Win: 0 / Lose: -8 ⚠️ | 14 | Win: +2 / Lose: -14 ⚠️ |
| 35-44        | 2.0x            | 10             | Win: -2 / Lose: -10 ❌ | 18 | Win: -2 / Lose: -18 ❌ |
| 45+          | 2.5x            | 13             | Win: -5 / Lose: -13 ❌ | 23 | Win: -7 / Lose: -23 ❌ |

**Base Insurance Costs:**
- +8 parlay (4 picks): 5 (×multiplier, rounded to whole number)
- +16 parlay (5 picks): 9 (×multiplier, rounded to whole number)

### Insurance Unlock Mechanic

**"Earn Your Insurance Back"**

You can only have **ONE insured parlay active at a time**. After an insured parlay resolves, insurance becomes **LOCKED** until an uninsured bet/parlay resolves **AFTER** it.

**How it works:**
1. Use insurance on Parlay A (4-5 bets)
2. Parlay A locks, insurance cost deducted immediately
3. Insurance is now **LOCKED** (can't insure other parlays yet)
4. Parlay A resolves (hit or miss, doesn't matter)
5. Insurance still **LOCKED**
6. An uninsured bet/parlay must resolve **AFTER** Parlay A
7. Once uninsured bet resolves → Insurance **UNLOCKS**
8. Can now insure another 4-5 bet parlay

**Critical Rule:** The uninsured bet that unlocks insurance must be from a **DIFFERENT game** (resolves at different time) than the insured parlay. This prevents gaming the system.

**Example Flow:**
- **2pm:** Create Parlay A (3pm + 7pm games, 4 bets, +8) with insurance (5 cost)
  - Streak: 20 → 15 (insurance deducted), Insurance LOCKED
- **3pm:** Create Parlay B (4pm game, 1 bet, +1) uninsured
- **7pm:** Parlay A's last game finishes → MISSES
  - Streak survives at 15 (was insured)
  - Insurance still LOCKED
- **8pm:** Parlay B finishes → HITS
  - Streak: 15 + 1 = 16
  - Insurance **UNLOCKS** (uninsured bet resolved after insured parlay)
- **8:30pm:** Create Parlay C (9pm + 10pm games, 5 bets, +16)
  - Can add insurance (now available)

---

## Strategic Depth & Game Phases

The insurance scaling creates natural phases of gameplay:

### Phase 1: Early Growth (Streak 0-9)
- **Insurance is affordable** (1.0x base cost)
- Can build momentum safely with insured parlays
- +8 insured parlay nets +3 to streak
- +16 insured parlay nets +7 to streak
- But must alternate with uninsured bets
- Strategy: Use insurance aggressively to build foundation

### Phase 2: Steady Climb (Streak 10-24)
- **Insurance still profitable** (1.25x)
- +8 insured parlay nets +2 to streak
- +16 insured parlay nets +5 to streak
- Sweet spot for consistent growth
- Strategy: Balance insured big parlays with uninsured singles

### Phase 3: The Decision Point (Streak 25-34)
- **Insurance at break-even** (1.5x)
- +8 insured parlay nets 0 (just protection)
- +16 insured parlay nets +2 (marginal gain)
- Must decide: Pay for protection or risk it?
- Strategy: Careful consideration of each insurance decision, might opt for smaller uninsured parlays

### Phase 4: High Stakes (Streak 35-44)
- **Insurance is unprofitable** (2.0x)
- Using insurance means going backwards even if you win
- Must play uninsured or accept losses
- Strategy: Either play safe 1-3 pick parlays uninsured, or go for broke on big uninsured parlays

### Phase 5: The Gauntlet (Streak 45+)
- **Insurance is completely worthless** (2.5x)
- No viable safety net
- Every pick is life or death
- Strategy: Pure skill and guts - this is where legends are made

**The Beauty:** The game naturally prevents runaway leaders. Insurance remains viable much longer (up to streak 24), giving players a real path to build momentum. But as streaks climb higher, insurance becomes a tough decision (25-34), then unprofitable (35+). At 45+ streak, you're playing pure risk - no insurance can save you.

## Advanced Example: Using Insurance

**Player at Streak: 20**

**Morning Strategy:**
- Build big insured parlay for afternoon/evening games
- Build quick uninsured bet to unlock insurance for late games

**11:00 AM:**
- Parlay A: [Warriors ML (3pm), Bucks ML (7pm), Heat over 210 (7:30pm), Nuggets -3 (9pm)] 
- 4 bets, +8, Insurance: 5 cost
- Lock with insurance → Streak: 20 - 5 = **15**, Insurance LOCKED

**12:00 PM:**
- Parlay B: [Lakers ML (1pm)]
- 1 bet, +1, No insurance
- Lock Parlay B

**1:30 PM:**
- Lakers game ends → **WINS**
- Parlay B resolves: Streak: 15 + 1 = **16**
- Insurance still LOCKED (insured parlay hasn't resolved yet)

**9:30 PM:**
- Nuggets game ends (last game in Parlay A) → **PARLAY A MISSES** (Nuggets lost)
- Parlay A resolves: Streak survives at **16** (was insured!)
- Insurance still LOCKED (need uninsured bet to resolve AFTER this)

**Next Day - 1:00 PM:**
- Quick bet: [Celtics ML]
- 1 bet, +1, Uninsured
- **Celtics WIN** → Streak: 16 + 1 = **17**
- Insurance **UNLOCKS** (uninsured bet resolved after insured parlay)
- Can now insure another big parlay!

## Key Design Principles

### 1. **Simple to Learn, Hard to Master**
- Basic concept: Pick bets, build parlays, all must hit to advance streak
- Depth comes from: parlay construction, timing, insurance management, resolution order
- Easy to play casually, deep strategy for hardcore players

### 2. **You Control the Difficulty**
- Want to play safe? Build single bets throughout the day
- Want to climb fast? Build big 4-5 bet parlays across games
- Multiple active parlays? Manage risk across different time windows
- The game meets you where you are

### 3. **Natural Difficulty Curve**
- Low streaks (0-24): Insurance is profitable, helps you build momentum
- Medium streaks (25-34): Insurance at break-even, tough decisions on when to use it
- High streaks (35-44): Insurance unprofitable, must choose safe uninsured picks or risky big parlays
- Elite streaks (45+): No insurance viable, pure skill and guts
- The game gets progressively harder as you succeed (prevents runaway leaders)

### 4. **All-Day Engagement**
- Build parlays throughout the morning for afternoon/evening games
- Multiple time windows across different sports
- Watch games as parlays resolve in real-time
- Can play as much or as little as you want
- No forced grinding, no daily minimums

### 5. **Strategic Depth Across Multiple Dimensions**
- **Bet selection:** Which games/props to trust
- **Parlay construction:** Combine games across time zones strategically
- **Insurance timing:** When to protect your streak vs go uninsured
- **Resolution order:** Plan which parlays resolve when
- **Risk management:** Balance multiple active parlays

### 6. **Social & Competitive**
- See friends' active parlays and streaks
- Watch together as parlays resolve
- Trash talk when someone's 20-streak dies on a bad beat
- Leaderboards create natural competition

### 7. **Risk/Reward Drama**
- Every parlay resolution changes your streak
- Insurance decisions create tension
- Multiple parlays = multiple moments of drama throughout the day
- Big streaks are rare and celebrated

---

## Why This Works

### Solves the "Parlay Problem"
Parlays rarely hit, which makes them bad for traditional streak games. Our solution:
- Players CHOOSE when to build parlays (not forced)
- Can build safe single bets or risky multi-game parlays
- Parlay values reflect the increased difficulty
- Insurance makes big swings viable (but at a cost)
- Singles are always available for safe play
- Multiple simultaneous parlays allow for diversified risk

### Differentiation from Traditional Sportsbooks
- Not gambling against the house
- Social competition, not just winning money
- Streak mechanics create long-term engagement narrative
- Free to play (or minimal stakes)
- Leaderboards and bragging rights
- Curated picks ensure quality and accessibility
- Cross-game parlays create unique combinations
- Watch your streak evolve throughout the day as parlays resolve

### Better than Basic Prediction Games (like ESPN Streak)
- Way more strategic depth than "pick one per day"
- Parlay system across multiple games adds complexity
- Insurance system creates evolving meta-game
- Scales from casual (single bets) to hardcore (multi-parlay strategies)
- Multiple picks per day across different sports/times
- All-day engagement: Build in morning, watch resolve in evening
- Resolution order creates narrative arc throughout the day

### The Multi-Parlay Advantage
The ability to have multiple active parlays simultaneously creates unique gameplay:
- **Portfolio management:** Diversify risk across different games
- **Time-based strategy:** Plan early vs late parlays
- **Insurance choreography:** Strategic use of insurance + uninsured bets
- **Comeback mechanics:** If one parlay busts, others can still build from 0
- **Social tension:** Friends watch each other's parlays resolve in real-time
- **Peak engagement:** Multiple resolution moments = multiple dopamine hits

---

## Emergent Strategies & Meta-Game

The multi-parlay system creates interesting strategic patterns:

### Strategy 1: "The Hedge"
- Build safe single bet that resolves early
- Build risky 5-bet parlay that resolves late
- If single bet hits early, gives you cushion if big parlay misses
- If single bet misses, big parlay builds from 0

### Strategy 2: "Insurance Dance"
- Build 4-bet insured parlay (afternoon games)
- Build single uninsured bet (early game) to unlock insurance
- Once unlocked, build another 4-bet insured parlay (evening games)
- Maximize use of insurance throughout the day

### Strategy 3: "The Ladder"
- Build multiple small parlays throughout day
- Each builds on previous success
- Steady, safe growth vs big swings

### Strategy 4: "All or Nothing"
- Put everything into one massive 5-bet parlay
- High risk, high reward
- Either climb 16+ in one day or reset to 0

### Strategy 5: "The Morning Builder"
- Build all parlays in the morning before any games start
- Lock in your strategy for the day
- Sit back and watch the chaos unfold

### Strategy 6: "The Live Player"
- Wait for early games to resolve
- Adjust strategy based on how your streak is doing
- Build parlays reactively throughout the day

The best players will mix these strategies based on:
- Current streak level
- Insurance availability
- Time of day / games remaining
- Risk tolerance

   - Resolution engine (chronological order, insurance tracking)
   - Real-time updates as games finish
   - State management for multiple active parlays

2. **UI/UX Mockups** - Design the user flows and interfaces
   - Main game browsing page
   - Game detail pages with additional bets
   - Parlay builder interface (cart-like system?)
   - Active parlays dashboard
   - Live resolution view

3. **Data Requirements** - Sports data APIs, real-time odds, game results
   - Real-time game scores
   - Prop bet outcomes (player stats)
   - Fast, reliable data for resolution
   - Bet curation system

4. **MVP Scope** - What's the minimum viable version to test?
   - Single sport (NBA?) to start
   - Limited bet types initially
   - Basic insurance mechanics
   - Core parlay + resolution system

5. **Legal Considerations** - Compliance, licensing (depending on real money vs play money)
   - Start with play money recommended
   - Real money requires significant legal work

---

## Questions to Resolve Before Building

1. **Real money or play money to start?**
   - Affects legal requirements, payment processing, user acquisition
   - **Recommendation:** Start with play money

2. **Which sports/leagues initially?**
   - NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL? Start with one or multiple?
   - **Recommendation:** Start with NBA (lots of props, frequent games, year-round)

3. **Bet curation strategy:**
   - **Who curates?** Manual curation by team vs automated from odds APIs?
   - **Selection criteria?** How do we choose the main bet per game?
   - **Additional bets?** How do we select the 5-10 additional options per game?
   - **Quality control?** How do we ensure variety and interesting options?
   - **Recommendation:** Start automated from API, manual curation for featured picks

4. **Parlay UX:**
   - **Cart-style builder?** Add bets to cart, then lock in parlay?
   - **Multiple carts?** How do users manage multiple simultaneous parlays?
   - **Lock timing?** Manual lock vs auto-lock when first game starts?
   - **Edit parlays?** Can you modify before lock?

5. **Resolution Engine:**
   - **Real-time updates?** Push notifications when parlays resolve?
   - **Live tracking?** Show individual bet status as games progress?
   - **Manual overrides?** For disputed outcomes or API failures?

6. **Social features priority?**
   - Friend-only leagues or public leaderboards first?
   - Live spectating of friends' parlays?

7. **Platform:**
   - Web app? Native mobile? Both?
   - **Recommendation:** Web-first for MVP, mobile later

8. **Timeline:**
   - MVP in 4 weeks? 8 weeks? 12 weeks?

## Technical Complexity Considerations

The multi-parlay system introduces interesting technical challenges:

### State Management
- **Multiple active parlays per user** with different lock times
- **Insurance state tracking** (locked/unlocked, which parlay was insured)
- **Resolution queue** (chronological order of parlay completions)
- **Streak history** (need to track how streak evolved throughout day)

### Resolution Engine
**Key Requirements:**
1. Monitor all active parlays across all users
2. Track individual bet outcomes in real-time
3. Determine when a parlay is "complete" (all games finished)
4. Resolve parlays in chronological order per user
5. Apply insurance rules correctly
6. Update streaks atomically
7. Trigger insurance unlock checks

**Example Flow:**
```
User has 3 active parlays:
- Parlay A: [1pm game, 3pm game] - Insured
- Parlay B: [2pm game] - Uninsured  
- Parlay C: [7pm game, 9pm game] - Uninsured

Resolution Timeline:
2:00pm → Parlay B completes → Check outcome → Update streak → Check insurance unlock (no, insured parlay not resolved yet)
3:00pm → Parlay A completes → Check outcome → Apply insurance if needed → Update streak
7:00pm → Parlay C's first game completes, but parlay still active
9:00pm → Parlay C completes → Check outcome → Update streak → Check insurance unlock (yes! uninsured resolved after insured)
```

### Data Requirements
- **Game start times** (for locking)
- **Game end times** (for resolution timing)
- **Real-time scores** (for live tracking, optional for MVP)
- **Prop outcomes** (player stats, game totals, etc.)
- **Fast, reliable data** (users will notice delays)

### Edge Cases to Handle
- **Postponed games** - What happens to parlays?
- **Canceled games** - Push the bet? Void parlay?
- **API failures** - Manual resolution needed?
- **Tie scenarios** - Push or loss?
- **Same-game detection** - For insurance unlock validation
- **Race conditions** - Multiple parlays completing simultaneously

### Database Schema Considerations
**Key Tables:**
- `users` (current_streak, insurance_locked, last_insured_parlay_id)
- `parlays` (user_id, bets[], status, insured, insurance_cost, locked_at, resolved_at)
- `bets` (game_id, bet_type, bet_value, outcome, resolved_at)
- `games` (start_time, end_time, status, scores)
- `streak_history` (user_id, timestamp, old_streak, new_streak, parlay_id)

### Performance Considerations
- Index on game end times for resolution queue
- Efficient queries for "all parlays ready to resolve"
- Caching for leaderboards
- Real-time updates (websockets?) for live parlay tracking

- Each parlay locks when its first game starts
- All bets in parlay must hit to advance streak

### Insurance Costs (Base)
- +8 parlay (4 bets): 5
- +16 parlay (5 bets): 9

### Insurance Streak Multipliers

- All costs rounded to whole numbers

### Resolution
- Parlays resolve in chronological order (by completion time)
- Streak updates with each resolution
- Multiple active parlays can exist simultaneously
- If uninsured parlay loses → streak resets to 0
- If insured parlay loses → pay insurance cost, streak survives
